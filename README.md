Modelling 1D lithium-ion battery interface for studying the discharge and charge of a lithium-ion battery for a choice of materials and dimensions for different type of electrolyte, separator, current collectors, negative and positive electrode.
3D model is utilized for thermal simulations, encompassing the flow around the battery within a compartment and heat source in an active battery material domain calculated by heat generated in 1D model, which affects the heat transfer rate.
